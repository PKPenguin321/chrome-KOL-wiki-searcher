# chrome-KOL-wiki-searcher
stupid simple extension for chrome that lets you access the KoL (that is, the Kingdom of Loathing) wiki more easily.

just click the extension button, type in a keyword (such as an item or quest name), push go (or hit enter), and it will attempt to redirect you to a wiki page.

built because the KoL wiki is a bit laggy, and accessing the main page just to make a search can be a pain. icon images are by Jick

# install guide

download the repo as a folder

in chrome, go to the Extensions page and enable dev mode

press "Load unpacked" in the Extensions page and target the repo folder

enable

this is unorthodox but has to be done since you can only install .crx (packed extension files) from google now, and uploading to their store costs $5 (and imo this isnt worth spending $5 to upload to the store).

once youre done you can disable dev mode, but chrome may nag you to disable "dev extensions" (by that it means third-party extensions) afterwords. just ignore it. you can also just leave dev mode on, up to you.
