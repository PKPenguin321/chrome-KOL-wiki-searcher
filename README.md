# chrome-KOL-wiki-searcher
stupid simple extension for chrome that lets you access the KoL wiki more easily.

just type in a keyword (such as an item or quest name) and push go (or hit enter) and it will attempt to redirect you to a wiki page.

built because the KoL wiki is a bit laggy, and accessing the main page just to make a search can be a pain. icon images are by Jick
